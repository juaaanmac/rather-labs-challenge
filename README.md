# RATHER LABS CHALLENGE

RATHER LABS CHALLENGE

Honestly, I could not develop the challenge as I would have liked because when I downloaded the Sushiswap project from github, I received errors when installing the dependencies in the sushiswap and masterchef protocols, and I could not compile them. This made it difficult to generate the artifacts and I had to do things a bit messy, however I could not do it with the Masterchef contract.

#### Run tests

`npm run test`

#### Deploy contracts

`npm run deploy`
